# Integration changelog

Each integration needs a changelog to inform about releases, roll backs and so.

This changelog won't be at the documentation page, and will be kept with the source code repository on a **single file** called **_"CHANGELOG.md"_**.

This file will be copied on the documentation changelog by generating **a folder per date** with a single file called **_"index.md"_**.

Thus on the public documentation site we'll have:

* ...\changelog\2000-01-31\index.md
* ...\changelog\2000-02-01\index.md
* ...\changelog\... as folders as needed

## CHANGELOG.md structure

the file will have the following structure:

- **No header**
- **Grouped by release**: On each release the changelog is grouped under a title 2 with the date in format iso (AAAA-MM-DD)
- **Incremental notation**: Changes not applied yet on a release will be at the top of the file with no title, once published a date title will be written on the top.
- **Use containers with lists**: All the entrances are treated as a list in a release note container 
- Remember that containers can be of type: 
  - `Added` for new features.
  - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
  - `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
  - `Removed` for now removed features.
  - `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
  - `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
