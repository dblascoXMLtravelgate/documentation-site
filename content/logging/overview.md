In order to **analyze useful metrics** about performance, Logging extracts, loads and stores data from all TravelgateX products.

Once the metrics are stored in our infrastructure, you can query and analyze your performance using [API Logging query](https://api.travelgatex.com/) or [TravelgateX Logging Web](https://www.travelgatex.com/logging/)
