In order to **analyze useful metrics** about performance, Stats extracts, loads and stores data from all TravelgateX products.

Once the metrics are stored in our infrastructure, you can query and analyze your performance using [API stats query](https://api.travelgatex.com/) or [TravelgateX Stats Web](https://www.travelgatex.com/stats/)
